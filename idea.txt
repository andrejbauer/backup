THE NEW SCHEME


The scheme is always as follows:


 +------+                      +------+
 |CLIENT|                      |SERVER|
 |      |======ssh tunnel======|cp -al|
 |rsyncd|                      |rsync |
 +------+                      +------+


The only difference is in who initiates the backup.

Only one ssh connection is open during one backup.

Only predetermined and fixed commands are run remotely via ssh.


Client initiated backup:
1. Client starts rsyncd
2. Client connects to server with ssh,
   does rsyncd port forwarding to the server
3. The ssh connection initiates a fixed command,
   which starts the backup.

Server initiated backup:
1. Server connects to client with ssh,
   does port forwarding for rsyncd
2. Client starts a fixed command which starts the
   rsyncd server.
3. Client signals to the server that the server that
   rsyncd is ready.
5. Server proceeds with backup.


Here is what we would write into ~/.ssh/.authorized_keys on the server

    from="client.machine.com" command="/initiate/backup" no-agent-forwarding\
    no-X11-forwarding no-pty permitopen="client.machine.com:port" <rsa_key>


Here is what we would write into ~/.ssh/.authorized_keys on the client
  
    from="server.machine.com" command="/initiate/rsyncd" no-agent-forwarding\
    no-X11-forwarding no-pty permitopen="server.machine.com:port" <rsa_key>
