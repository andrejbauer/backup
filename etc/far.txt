INITIALIZATION OF FAR BACKUPS
=============================

Assume we have already set up remote backups on remote.machine.com and
want to set up far backups on far.mahchine.com.

1. Make sure remote.machine.com supports encrypted loopback devices,
   in addition to whatever is needed for remote backups.

2. Make sure far.machine.com supports ssh and rsync.

PROCEDURE ON remote.machine.com:
--------------------------------

3. On remote.machine.com create an encrypted loopback device, as follows.
   Input parameters:

   <size> = max total size of backups, in gigabytes
   <dir>  = directory in which to put the loopback file
   <password>

   Run:

	dd if=/dev/zero of=<dir>/block bs=1GB seek=<size> count=0
	echo "<password>" | losetup -e aes -p 0 /dev/loop0 <dir>/block
	mke2fs /dev/loop0
        mkdir <dir>/far

   Add the following line to your /etc/fstab on remote.machine.com:

	<file>    <dir>/far    ext2    encryption=aes,user     0       0

4. Mount the loopback device:

	echo "<password>" | mount <dir>/far -p 0

5. Rsync the ordinary backups into the loopback. Suppose the backups
   live in the directory <backup_dir>:

	rsync -azHS <backup_dir> <dir>/far

6. Unmount the loopback:

        umount <dir>/far

7. Create specialized ssh keys:

	ssh-keygen -N "" -f <dir>/backup_id_rsa -t rsa -b 1024

8. Transport backup_id_rsa.pub to far.machine.com.


PROCEDURE ON far.machine.com:
-----------------------------

9. On far.machine.com do the following:

   - Create an account, say backup-user, with home directory /home/backup-user,
     make sure it has a functioning ~/.ssh directory with an authorized_keys
     file. If it doesn't, run ssh from it then do, as backup-user:

	touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
	chmod go-rw ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

   - Add the following SINGLE line to /home/backup-user/.ssh/authorized_keys:

no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty,command="/usr/bin/rsync --sparse --times --block-size=65536 --server /home/backup-user/block" <content-of-backup_id_rsa.pub>

     NOTE: the above rsync command may not be quite right. If you encounter problems,
     remove the command option from the authorized_keys, run backup and see (using
     "ps auxwww | grep rsync" what is the actual command that should be running).

INITIAL TRANSFER OF THE BACKUP:
-------------------------------

10. Rsync the block file from remote.machine.com to far.machine.com.
    Run this on remote.machine.com:

	rsync --sparse --times -e 'ssh -i <dir>/backup_id_rsa -l backup-user' \
              <dir>/block far.machine.com:/home/backup-user/block
